# Reservoir-Water-Level-Detection
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust embedded system capable of activating visual and audible alerts when water level is detected at a distance less than 10 cm from the sensor. To achieve this, the system integrates an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement, along with LEDs and a buzzer for indicating proximity
